  <h1>Qilu(Luna) Huang</h1>
  <p><em>A Graduate Student in <strong>Northeastern University</strong></em></p>
  <p>I am a highly ambitious and driven individual, currently pursuing an MS degree in Information Systems at Northeastern University. My previous professional experience as a traffic engineer further deepened my passion for program design and driven data decision making. It encouraged me to learn new programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL. I am passionate about creating applications to solve real-world problems. I am currently looking for internships and other opportunities to further my experience as a software developer engineer. I work best in environments where I can collaborate with others to meet team goals. </p>
